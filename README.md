# SenseCAP Solar P1 Meshtastic Relay Deployment

*A Recollection of my Obtainment and Deployment of a SenseCAP Solar P1 Meshtastic Relay*
## 📌 Project Status  
![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-DONE!-green)
* [**Received All Hardware**](https://github.com/VKG7125/SenseCAP-Solar-P1-Relay-Deployment?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-hardware-obtained--all-received)
* I will determine if I should purchase a 5.8 dBi fiberglass antenna later.
* I also went ahead and created a [Community Flyer](https://github.com/VKG7125/SenseCAP-Solar-P1-Relay-Deployment?tab=readme-ov-file#-resources-created) for my local community. 
* The **main goal right now** is actually getting it up and running — regardless of range.

## 📖 Overview

This repository documents the obtaining, configuring, and deploying a [SenseCAP Solar P1 Meshtastic relay](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Solar-Node-P1-for-Meshtastic-LoRa-p-6425.html). It includes resources and configurations to help others replicate this deployment.

## 🛠️ Hardware Obtained (✅ All Received)

* [**SenseCAP Solar P1** Meshtastic Relay](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Solar-Node-P1-for-Meshtastic-LoRa-p-6425.html)
* [Samsung 35E 18650 Button Top 3500mAh Battery **(Quantity of 4)**](https://www.18650batterystore.com/products/samsung-35e-protected)
* [SenseCAP Card Tracker T1000-E for Meshtastic *(My choice of communicator)*](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Card-Tracker-T1000-E-for-Meshtastic-p-5913.html)

## ⚙️ Hardware/Software Configuration

1. **Basic Setup**

   * Primarily configured with the Meshtastic mobile app.
   * Configuration was pretty straightfoward. I set the role as `router` rather than client, as it is just a relay and I'm and using the T1000-E as a communicator. 

3. **Custom Settings**

   * The name was set *VKGR* (Long name: *VKG7125 Relay 1*)
   * Admin was setup with the T1000-E's public key, but I have yet to actually utilize it.
