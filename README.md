## 🛠️ Hardware Obtained

* [Samsung 35E 18650 Button Top 3500mAh Battery **(Quantity of 4)**](https://www.18650batterystore.com/products/samsung-35e-protected)
* [SenseCAP Card Tracker T1000-E for Meshtastic *(My choice of communicator)*](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Card-Tracker-T1000-E-for-Meshtastic-p-5913.html)

## ⚙️ Hardware/Software Configuration

1. **Basic Setup**

   * Primarily configured with the Meshtastic mobile app.
   * Configuration was pretty straightfoward. I set the role as `router` rather than client, as it is just a relay and I'm and using the T1000-E as a communicator. 

3. **Custom Settings**

   * The name was set *VKGR* (Long name: *VKG7125 Relay 1*)
   * Admin was setup with the T1000-E's public key, but I have yet to actually utilize it.
