# SenseCAP Solar P1 Meshtastic Relay Deployment

*A Recollection of my Obtainment and Deployment of a SenseCAP Solar P1 Meshtastic Relay*
## 📌 Project Status  
![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In_Progress-yellow)
* I have currently ordered all of the hardware listed in the [Hardware](https://github.com/VKG7125/SenseCAP-Solar-P1-Relay-Deployment?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-hardware-obtained-purchased) section below.
* I will determine if I should purchase a 5.8 dBi fiberglass antenna later.
* I also went ahead and created a [Community Flyer](https://github.com/VKG7125/SenseCAP-Solar-P1-Relay-Deployment?tab=readme-ov-file#-resources-created) for my local community. 
* The **main goal right now** is actually getting it up and running — regardless of range.
